<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>This repository contains example notebooks that can help you start using SciServer for your data science and science education projects.</p>

<p>To see these Example Notebooks, create a new container in SciServer Compute. At the bottom of the <em>Create a new container</em> dialog box, you will see a list of <strong>Data volumes</strong>. Be sure the checkbox next to <strong>Getting started</strong> is checked.</p>

<p>Once you create the container with the Getting Started data volume mounted, you can access the Example Notebooks by going to the <em>getting_started</em> volume.

Follow the instructions below to install the example notebooks in one of your containers. You can modify the notebooks to suit your needs, but if you do we recommend that you copy them into a new folder so you can update the original example notebooks from our repository as needed.</p>
