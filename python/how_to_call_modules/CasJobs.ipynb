For longer queries, CasJobs has a system of <strong>jobs</strong>. When you submit a query to CasJobs, the system creates a job for your query, with a unique <code>jobId</code>. CasJobs then runs this job in the background as server resources permit. When it completes, the job writes the query results into your MyDB personal database space, into a table that you can specify.
